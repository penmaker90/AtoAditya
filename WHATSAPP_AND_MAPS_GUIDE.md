# WhatsApp Integration Fix Guide

## Issue: WhatsApp Not Sending Messages

### Step 1: Update Your WhatsApp Number

**Current number in code:** `919876543210` (This is a placeholder!)

**You need to replace this with YOUR actual WhatsApp number:**

1. Open `src/pages/Contact.tsx`
2. Find line ~75: `const phoneNumber = "919876543210";`
3. Replace with your actual WhatsApp number

### Step 2: WhatsApp Number Format

**Correct format:** Country code + phone number (no spaces, no + sign)

**Examples:**
- **India +91 98765 43210** → `"919876543210"`
- **USA +1 555 123 4567** → `"15551234567"`
- **UK +44 7911 123456** → `"447911123456"`

### Step 3: Test WhatsApp Integration

1. **Update the phone number** in Contact.tsx
2. **Click the "Chat with Us" button** on your website
3. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console) for debug logs:
   - 📱 WhatsApp URL: https://wa.me/YOURNUMBER?text=...
   - 📞 Phone Number: YOURNUMBER
   - 💬 Message: Hi! I'm interested...

4. **Verify WhatsApp opens** with the correct number and message

### Step 4: Common WhatsApp Issues

#### Issue: "Phone number not on WhatsApp"
**Solution:** Make sure the number is active on WhatsApp

#### Issue: "Invalid phone number"
**Solution:** Check the format (no +, no spaces, include country code)

#### Issue: "WhatsApp doesn't open"
**Solution:** Make sure WhatsApp is installed or use WhatsApp Web

### Step 5: Alternative WhatsApp Numbers

If you don't have a business WhatsApp number, you can:

1. **Use your personal number** temporarily
2. **Get WhatsApp Business** (free)
3. **Use a virtual number** service
